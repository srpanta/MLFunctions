## Fubnctions:
Some important functions that are used in ML and Dl algorithms are plotted here.Inputs are in x-axis and outputs are in y-axis.
### Logistic or sigmoid Function:
$$sigmoid(z)=\frac{1}{1+exp(-z)}$$
In this function input $z$ can be from $$-\infty < z < \infty$$
## Libraries Used:
pyplot library from Matplotlib is used for plotting.
numpy library is used to create an array of input values.
